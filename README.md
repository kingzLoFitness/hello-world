"Your hello-world repository can be a place where you store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others." I had to quote this from the GitHub guide 'Hello World'.

Part of what's in store (coming soon):
****************************************
A redesign of RacketINK, for it is my main website I created that talked about me and showing of my designs for the web.  I will be adding in designs outside of the web to show that I can created from paper and then take the next steps in creating on the Computer's Canvas with my Wacom Pen; that is just for Illustrations within Illustrator.  Then there is Photoshop's power of creating the Websites, only after creation of layout "through/as a"______ (I'm trying to remember what that is called again).  Then from Paper to Photoshop.  Then from Photoshop to coding, not quite.  From Photoshop to Pseudocode (if that wasn't created in the first place as an outline (I'm guessing even for my redesign, because away from my logo and some paragraph content, I will be goin in from scratch).  

A design of kingzLoFitness.  I have some content, pictures, videos, audio, writings, website layout(s), first version of Logo.  This is based on fitness and neutrician.  This is something I'm into personally on a physical/spiritual/mental perspective.  I'm looking forward to being "'that programmer/designer guy', who's also into fitness".  

And of course further Web Design Work, both for practice (for that will be helpful to create similar designs from Websites such as templateMoster and the like) and for Working within this field as a FULL TIME 'Web Developer/Graphic Desinger' or 'Full Stack...'

I am familiar with code, from beginner to intermediate level, via C, C++, PHP w/ mySQL, but not towards the level of actually using it within my WORKS of the past, and to come.  I'm looking to create with the use of coding, as I'm going through "The Odin Project" as my journey through that path I've gone into (from the time I graduated Devry I know I was heading in this direction. (should've known from the time I created this account, back in 2011.  But then there's life outside of the computer and as I hear them say "The Obstacle is the Way"))...  with the overall use of Problem Solving.  A great reference on Problem Solving I got from an old textbook I got from BMCC (studied Computer Programming for my Associates Degree and then continued onwards into recieving my Bachelors Degree in "Computer Information Systems" at Devry in 2004).  

Why am I going through this now and not earlier?  

As I've gone through my journey for years on/off as a freelancer, I've been workout outside jobs that went from decently satisfying to income THEY are looking to give me on a minimum wage outcome.  No thank you.  Time to get back to "The Odin Project", as I'm currently here:
